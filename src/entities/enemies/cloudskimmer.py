# TODO: if bullet that hasn't bounced off a pipe, hits CloudSkimmer's gun, the gun should be destroyed/explode,
#  the CloudSkimmer should loose some HP and look scarred or maybe run away/off screen, back where it came from!
# TODO: When CloudSkimmer gets hit by the player, its face should turn angry and it could shoot faster for a while?
#  Or maybe when one of the CloudSkimmers dies, the others get angry and shoot faster?
# TODO: when one of the CloudSkimmers hits his teammate, the teammate should get angry and they should start shooting
#  at each other xD â€” this would only work if the CloudSkimmers hit each other VERY rarely - or maybe there could
#  be a 3% chance of this happening, so it doesn't happen too often, but still happens sometimes?
#  This would obviously be manually programmed, not done by the agent. Agent should only focus on hitting the player.

# TODO: Should there be random occasional cooldowns, so CloudSkimmers don't constantly fire?
# TODO ghosts should spawn in random colors. As they get damaged, they could change color or become more transparent.
#  When they die, the weapon should fall to the ground and the ghost should disappear.
# TODO ghosts need to be better shaded, with more detail. Possibly even have a subtle sprite animation (waves on bottom)
